# Execution Plan for Office Add‑ins MCP Server

This document outlines the steps required to build, test and maintain the
**Office Add‑ins MCP Server**.  The project uses the [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/) Python
framework to expose tools that can be consumed by Model Context Protocol
(MCP) clients.  The initial implementation focuses on a single tool that
fetches details of a Microsoft Office add‑in via its asset ID.

## 1. Project Setup

1. **Repository structure:** Create the following directory hierarchy:

   - `src/` — Contains the Python source code.
   - `docs/` — Holds documentation such as this execution plan.
   - `requirements.txt` — Lists external Python dependencies.
   - `README.md` — Describes the project and provides usage instructions.

2. **Python version:** Use Python 3.8 or higher.  FastMCP relies on modern
   features such as type annotations and asynchronous I/O.

3. **Virtual environment:** Create a virtual environment (via `python -m venv` or
   another tool) and activate it.  This isolates project dependencies from
   system packages.

4. **Install dependencies:** Add `fastmcp` and `httpx` to `requirements.txt`
   and install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 2. Implementing the MCP Server

1. **Instantiate the server:** Use `FastMCP(name="OfficeAddinsMCPServer", instructions="…")`
   to create the server instance.  The `instructions` string should explain
   the purpose of your server to the client.  FastMCP automatically
   generates server metadata from these arguments【358941758241362†L121-L135】.

2. **Define a tool:** Decorate an asynchronous function with `@mcp.tool()` to
   expose it as an MCP tool.  FastMCP reads type hints and the function
   docstring to generate the tool’s schema automatically【358941758241362†L121-L135】.
   In this project, the tool should be named `get_addin_details` and accept
   a single parameter `asset_id: str`.  Its responsibility is to call the
   Office Add‑ins API and return the resulting JSON as a Python dict.

3. **HTTP request:** Use an asynchronous HTTP client such as `httpx.AsyncClient`
   to perform the GET request to
   `https://api.addins.omex.office.net/api/addins/details?assetid={asset_id}`.
   Set a reasonable timeout and call `response.raise_for_status()` to
   propagate HTTP errors to the MCP client.  FastMCP converts exceptions
   into MCP error responses automatically【410474369011793†L504-L509】.

4. **SSE transport:** Start the server using `mcp.run(transport="sse", host="0.0.0.0",
   port=8000)` to enable Server‑Sent Events.  SSE allows remote MCP
   clients to connect via HTTP.  For local development or CLI tools
   choose `transport="stdio"`【410474369011793†L221-L227】.

## 3. Running and Testing

1. **Run the server:** Execute `python src/server.py`.  Confirm that it
   starts without errors and listens on the configured port.

2. **Test with an MCP client:** Use the FastMCP client library to connect
   and call the tool:

   ```python
   from fastmcp.client import Client
   import asyncio

   async def main():
       async with Client("http://localhost:8000") as client:
           result = await client.call_tool(
               "get_addin_details",
               {"asset_id": "WA104381441"}
           )
           print(result)

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

   The expected output is a dictionary containing the add‑in’s details as
   returned by the Office API.

3. **Error scenarios:** Test invalid asset IDs or network failures to ensure
   that exceptions are propagated correctly.  FastMCP will translate
   unhandled exceptions into structured error responses for the client【410474369011793†L504-L509】.

## 4. Documentation and Maintenance

1. **README:** Provide a bilingual README describing the project, how to
   install dependencies, run the server and test the tool.  Include a
   project structure overview and mention any prerequisites.

2. **Code quality:** Use meaningful docstrings, type hints and comments to
   improve maintainability.  FastMCP uses these docstrings to describe
   tools to the client【358941758241362†L121-L135】.

3. **Dependency updates:** Periodically check for updates to `fastmcp` and
   `httpx`, and update `requirements.txt` accordingly.

## 5. Future Enhancements

1. **Caching:** Implement caching to avoid repeated calls to the Office API
   for the same asset ID.  This could be an in‑memory cache or an
   external caching layer.

2. **Additional tools:** Expand the server with more tools, such as
   searching for add‑ins, listing user‑installed add‑ins, or retrieving
   other Microsoft 365 data.

3. **Authentication:** If the Office API introduces authentication
   requirements, integrate token handling and secure storage of
   credentials.

4. **Logging and monitoring:** Use the `Context` object provided by FastMCP
   to report progress, log events and provide more transparency to the
   client【410474369011793†L551-L558】.

## Conclusion

Following this plan will result in a functional MCP server that exposes a
single tool to retrieve Office add‑in details.  The design leverages FastMCP’s
decorator‑based API and type‑hinted schema generation to minimise boilerplate
code while providing a clear path for future enhancements.
