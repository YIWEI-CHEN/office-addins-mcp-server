# Office Addâ€‘ins MCP Server
[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆæœ¬](./README_zh_tw.md)

## Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for discovering and managing Microsoft Office Addâ€‘ins across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. This server enables AI agents to search add-ins and retrieve detailed metadata, install or uninstall add-ins, handle submission, validation, and publishing of custom add-ins.

This repository provides a comprehensive server implementation based on the
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** using the official Python SDK. MCP
standardizes how large language models (LLMs) communicate with external data
sources and tools.  The `FastMCP` class encapsulates the complexity of MCP
and lets developers expose ordinary Python functions as MCP tools or
resources with minimal boilerplate.

Currently, the server provides basic add-in detail retrieval functionality, with comprehensive add-in management features planned for future releases (see Roadmap section).

<!-- ## Features

* **Standardized interface:** MCP servers act like APIs for LLMs, allowing
  secure access to internal tools or data.
* **FastMCP convenience:** The SDK generates tool schemas from type hints
  and docstrings, minimizing boilerplate while supporting both synchronous
  and asynchronous functions.
* **Multiple transports:** Supports STDIO for local testing and CLI integration,
  Serverâ€‘Sent Events (SSE) for remote clients, and HTTP for streamable HTTP requests.
* **Async HTTP:** The tool uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to call the Office
  Addâ€‘ins API without blocking the event loop. -->

## Installation and Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies and virtual environments and includes a `pyproject.toml` configuration file and a `uv.lock` file to ensure reproducible builds across different environments.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

First, install uv if you haven't already:

```bash
# Install uv (cross-platform)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or on macOS with Homebrew
brew install uv

# Or on Windows with PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
``` -->

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> office-addins-mcp-server
   cd office-addins-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv**:

   ```bash
   # This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies
   # based on pyproject.toml and uv.lock
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment** (optional):

   ```bash
   # Activate the virtual environment manually
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `uv run` to execute commands in the virtual environment without activating it.

### Running the Server

You can run the server in several ways:

```bash
# Option 1: Using uv run (recommended)
uv run python src/server.py

# Option 2: After activating the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/server.py

# Option 3: Using the installed script (TBD)
uv run office-addins-mcp-server
```

## Server Configuration

The server supports multiple transport types and can be configured using environment variables:

### Transport Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure the server:

```bash
# .env file

# Transport configuration
TRANSPORT=stdio  # Default: Standard input/output
# TRANSPORT=sse   # Server-Sent Events for web deployment
# TRANSPORT=http  # Streamable HTTP transport

# Network configuration (for SSE and HTTP transports)
HOST=0.0.0.0     # Default: Listen on all interfaces
PORT=8000        # Default: Port 8000
PATH_PREFIX=/    # Default: Root path (for future HTTP routing)
SSE_PATH=/sse    # Default: SSE endpoint path
```

**Transport Types:**
- **`stdio`** (default): Standard input/output transport, perfect for local testing and CLI integration
- **`sse`**: Server-Sent Events transport, ideal for web service deployment
- **`http`**: Streamable HTTP transport, suitable for HTTP-based integrations

### Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can modify the transport directly in `src/server.py` by editing the call to `run_server(transport="your_transport")` in the `main()` function.

### Configuration Options

**Available Environment Variables:**
- `TRANSPORT`: Transport type (`stdio`, `sse`, `http`) - Default: `stdio`
- `HOST`: Host to bind to - Default: `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
- `PORT`: Port to listen on - Default: `8000`
- `PATH_PREFIX`: Path prefix for HTTP routing - Default: `/`
- `SSE_PATH`: SSE endpoint path - Default: `/sse`

### Default Settings

By default the server:
- Uses STDIO transport
- Listens on `0.0.0.0:8000` (for SSE/HTTP transports)
- Uses root path (`/`) for routing
- Loads all configuration from `.env` file if present

## Testing the Server

To verify that the server works, connect with an MCPâ€‘compatible client and
invoke the `get_addin_details` tool.  The official SDK provides CLI tools
via `uv run mcp`.  For example:

```bash
# Start the server in development mode
uv run mcp dev src/server.py

# Or install it into Claude Desktop
uv run mcp install src/server.py
```

Once running, you can connect using Claude Desktop or the MCP Inspector to
test the tool.  Refer to the official documentation for writing custom
clients.
